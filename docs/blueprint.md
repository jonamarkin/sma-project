## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich gold (#D4AF37), evokes a sense of history, elegance, and the cultural richness of Africa, while avoiding overly literal or clich√© choices.
- Background color: Soft beige (#F5F5DC), provides a clean and neutral backdrop that complements the primary color without overpowering it; the low saturation and high brightness support a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Deep brown (#8B4513), complements the primary and background, enhancing readability and providing visual anchors; its deeper tone is significantly different in brightness and saturation from the primary color.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif with an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel
- Use minimalist icons related to musical elements and event management.
- Clean and elegant layout to enhance the user experience.
